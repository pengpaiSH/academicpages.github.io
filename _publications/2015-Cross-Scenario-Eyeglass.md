excerpt: 'In this paper, we present FGSS (Fashion Glasses Search System), an innovative cross-scenario eyeglasses retrieval system which automatically recognizes eyeglasses in real-world photos, e.g. the photo of a fashion girl with a stylish pair of eyeglasses, and retrieves a ranking list of visually similar product instances from the database. We propose a novel segmentation-free framework for FGSS to bridge two search gaps, semantic gap and feature gap, where a new type of keypoint-based scheme called EGYPT is tailored for eyeglasses to facilitate the search. In the EGYPT, we use the hybrid descriptors which combine the shape, color and texture features as a feature representation for eyeglasses. The experimental study on the real-world photo dataset and eyeglasses product dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of EGYPT model.'
