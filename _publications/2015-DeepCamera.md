excerpt: 'In this work, we present a novel project called DeepCamera(DC) for recognizing places-of-interest(POI) with smartphones. Our framework is based on deep convolutional neural networks(ConvNets) which are currently state-of-the-art solutions to vision recognition tasks such as our mission. We propose a novel ConvNet by introducing a new layer called "spatial layer" which captures spatial knowledge from a geographic view. As a result, both spatial and visual knowledge contribute to generating a hybrid probability distribution over all possible POI candidates. Furthermore, we compress multiple trained deep ConvNets into one single shallow net called "shNet" which achieves competitive performance with ensemble methods. Our preliminary experiments conducted on real-world dataset have shown promising POI recognition results.'
